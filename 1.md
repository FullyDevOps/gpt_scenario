## 2) Step-by-Step Execution Plan (CONTINUATION — fill gaps & add “operational depth”)

### Stage 7: Lab testing plan + COA workflow (release criteria + frequencies) 🧪

**Goal:** every production lot is *held* until results meet *your written specs*.

#### 7.1 Define “Lot” (non-negotiable)

Use **1 lot = 1 SKU + 1 drying run + 1 milling/sieving run + 1 packaging run** (max 1 shift/day recommended).

* Lot ID format: `SKU-YYMMDD-Shift-Run#` (example: `BTR-260208-A-01`).

#### 7.2 Sampling plan (simple, auditable)

For each lot:

1. **Composite sample for lab:** take **10 increments** across the lot (start/middle/end of packaging + multiple cartons), combine into 1 composite.
2. **Retain samples:** keep **2 sealed retains** (see Section 4):

   * Retain A (quality), Retain B (investigation/trace).
3. **Chain-of-custody:** seal bag + sign/date + lot ID + sample weight + sampling points.

#### 7.3 “Release testing” panel (per lot)

Minimum panel for **each lot, each SKU**:

* **Moisture %**
* **Water activity (aw)** (critical for low-moisture RTE hygiene approach)
* **Micro:** TAMC, Yeast/Mold, Coliforms, **E. coli**, **Salmonella (absent)**
* **Heavy metals:** Pb, Cd, As, Hg (either per-lot initially or per “verification schedule” below)
* **Foreign matter checks:** sieve record + magnet record + metal detector log (in-house)

> Low-moisture RTE foods have specific sanitation expectations (pathogen prevention mindset). Build sanitation zoning + environmental controls accordingly. ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][1])

#### 7.4 Verification testing schedule (cost control, still defensible)

After **3 consecutive compliant lots per SKU**:

* **Heavy metals:** move to **quarterly per SKU** (unless you sell into strict markets → keep per lot).
* **Pesticide multi-residue:**

  * Conventional: **quarterly per SKU** (or per supplier change).
  * Organic: **every lot initially**, then **monthly per SKU** once stable supplier + certifier acceptance.
* **Aflatoxins:** **annual per SKU** (or if any raw material risk flags appear).
* **Nitrates (beetroot):** optional; do **baseline + annual** unless you plan a claim.

#### 7.5 COA workflow (what happens every lot)

1. **Lot created → HOLD status** in inventory system.
2. Packaging completes → **finished goods quarantined** (separate physical zone).
3. Lab results received → QA compares to written specs.
4. If pass → **RELEASE**; if fail → **REJECT / REWORK / INVESTIGATE** (CAPA).
5. COA is stored **per lot** and linked to shipment packing list and Amazon inbound batches.

#### 7.6 COA must include (exact fields)

* Supplier/manufacturer name & address; facility ID
* SKU + Lot ID; mfg date; best-by date
* Package type (pouch/jar) + net weight
* Test methods + units + LOQ/LOD where relevant
* Results vs spec limits (show pass/fail)
* Lab name, address, accreditation scope (e.g., ISO 17025), analyst approval
* Sample receive date + report date

---

### Stage 8: Private label packaging workflow (artwork control + barcode + label approvals) 🎨

**Golden rule:** no label is printed without a signed “Label Release” record.

#### 8.1 Artwork & label governance

1. You maintain **Master Artwork Folder** (version controlled):

   * `Brand/SKU/Size/Format/Version/Date`
2. “Label Release Form” must include:

   * Regulatory check (ingredients, net qty, business statement, COO, allergens, NF)
   * Claims check (organic, non-GMO, gluten-free, etc.)
   * Amazon check (FNSKU placement, expiration date legibility)
3. Printer proof approval: **2-person sign-off** (Friend QA + You brand owner).

#### 8.2 Barcode strategy (do this once; scale to 10 SKUs easily)

* **UPC:** one UPC per unique retail unit (SKU × size × format).
  → That’s **5 SKUs × 2 sizes × 2 formats = 20 UPCs** now; scalable to 10 SKUs = 40 UPCs.
* **Amazon FNSKU:** applied for FBA units (do not print on consumer label unless you choose commingled strategy—usually avoid initially).

---

### Stage 9: Export readiness (India steps + logistics handoff)

Operational export packet per shipment:

* Commercial Invoice + Packing List
* COO statement (and any requested origin documentation)
* Lab COAs (per lot shipped)
* Pallet/packaging declaration + ISPM-15 statements if wood is used (use heat-treated or plastic pallets)
* Bill of Lading / Airway Bill
* Insurance certificate (if CIF/DDP)
* Organic: NOP Import Certificate flow (Section 6/7)

---

### Stage 10: US import readiness (you as importer)

#### 10.1 FSVP (you own this)

FSVP requires you (as the importer) to have a written program verifying imported food meets US safety standards and proper allergen labeling. ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][2])
Minimum actions you must document:

* hazard analysis for each food
* supplier performance evaluation
* supplier approval + verification activities (audit/testing/records)
* corrective actions + re-evaluation at least every 3 years ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][2])

FDA publishes record expectations and inspectors review your records during FSVP inspections. ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][3])

#### 10.2 Prior Notice (every shipment)

Prior Notice is required for food imported or offered for import; file via ACE/ABI or PNSI. ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][4])

#### 10.3 Facility registration (foreign facility)

Foreign food facilities shipping to the US must register with FDA and renew biennially in the renewal window. ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][5])
Registered foreign facilities must designate a **U.S. Agent** for FDA communications. ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][6])

---

### Stage 11: Shipping & customs clearance (recommended + fallback) 🚢✈️

## 11.A Shipment characteristics estimate (3,000 packs/month)

**Assumptions (clearly labeled):**

* Monthly units: **1,500 × 8 oz** and **1,500 × 16 oz**
* Case packs:

  * 8 oz pouch: 24 units/case
  * 16 oz pouch: 12 units/case
  * 8 oz jar: 12 units/case
  * 16 oz jar: 6 units/case
* Approx gross unit weights (product + primary pack + label):

  * 8 oz pouch: 0.25 kg
  * 16 oz pouch: 0.48 kg
  * 8 oz jar: 0.35 kg
  * 16 oz jar: 0.62 kg
* Approx case cube (carton volume):

  * 8 oz pouch case: 0.035 m³
  * 16 oz pouch case: 0.028 m³
  * 8 oz jar case: 0.031 m³
  * 16 oz jar case: 0.043 m³

### Monthly shipping footprint scenarios

| Scenario               | Gross weight (kg) | Volume (m³) | Practical LCL note |
| ---------------------- | ----------------: | ----------: | ------------------ |
| **100% pouches**       |            ~1,095 |        ~5.7 | Often 1–2 pallets  |
| **50/50 pouches+jars** |            ~1,275 |       ~10.2 | Often 3–4 pallets  |
| **100% jars**          |            ~1,455 |       ~14.6 | Often 5–6 pallets  |

*(These are planning numbers; your forwarder confirms final dims after cartonization.)*

---

## 11.B Best shipping method recommendation

### Beginner-safe recommended path ✅

1. **First shipment (pilot): Air freight (small batch)**

* Purpose: validate labeling, customs, Amazon category, customer feedback quickly.
* Ship: 300–600 units total (not full 3,000).

2. **Ongoing monthly: Ocean freight LCL (FOB origin port)**

* Your monthly volume (5.7–14.6 m³) is typically **LCL-friendly**.
* Avoid warehouse overstock and reduce cash lock.

### Advanced cost-optimization path 💰

* Consolidate to **one ocean LCL every 2 months**, or move to **FCL** only when:

  * you reliably exceed ~15–18 m³ monthly *or*
  * your cost per kg becomes unacceptable due to LCL fees.

---

## 11.C Incoterms recommendation (safest for beginner)

### Recommended for beginner: **FOB (India port) + you control freight**

* Reason: You avoid the hidden-risk zone of EXW (you’re responsible too early), and you avoid CIF/DDP ambiguity where cost/control can be opaque.

### Pros/cons quick table

| Incoterm | Pros                                                      | Cons                                                               | Beginner risk level                  |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **EXW**  | Cheapest on paper                                         | You handle pickup/export clearance coordination; high failure risk | 🔴 High                              |
| **FOB**  | Clear handoff at port; you control ocean/insurance/broker | You must set up forwarder/broker                                   | 🟢 Best                              |
| **CIF**  | Supplier arranges ocean + insurance                       | Less control; surprise local charges possible                      | 🟡 Medium                            |
| **DDP**  | “Delivered duty paid” simplicity                          | High price; compliance ambiguity (who is truly importer/FSVP?)     | 🟡/🔴 Risky unless provider is elite |

---

## 11.D Step-by-step import flow (FOB + Ocean LCL) — recommended

**People involved:** Friend (export), Freight Forwarder, Customs Broker, You (FSVP importer), Carrier

1. **Booking**

   1. You request quotes from 2–3 forwarders: origin pickup → LCL → Indiana/3PL/FBA.
   2. Confirm: transit time, free time, destination fees, customs brokerage.

2. **Factory packing**

   * Friend finalizes carton labels + pallet labels + lot/best-by marking.
   * Create **Packing List** mapping: pallet → cartons → lot IDs.

3. **Export clearance (India)**

   * Friend/forwarder files export declarations and hands cargo to carrier.

4. **ISF (ocean only)**

   * Your broker/forwarder files **ISF (10+2)** no later than **24 hours before vessel loading**. ([CBP Help][7])

5. **Prior Notice**

   * File FDA Prior Notice (often broker/forwarder does it, but **you remain responsible**). ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][4])

6. **Arrival → Customs entry**

   * Broker files entry package; FDA/CBP may exam.

7. **Country of origin marking check**

   * Units/cases must be marked “Product of India” (or equivalent). ([Customs and Border Protection][8])

8. **Delivery**

   * Deliver to: Indiana receiving location / 3PL / Amazon prep center.
   * Perform receiving QC: packaging integrity, lot/best-by visibility, random net weight checks.

### Fallback option: Air freight (FOB airport / CIP)

Same overall sequence but:

* No ISF step (ISF is ocean-specific).
* Use Airway Bill; faster FDA/CBP cycle; higher cost.

---

### Stage 12: Distribution choices (Indiana receiving → store/3PL/FBA)

**Inbound receiving SOP (every shipment):**

1. Quarantine pallets/cases
2. Visual inspection + photo record
3. Verify: COA present per lot, packing list matches cartons, seals intact
4. Release into inventory
5. Decide allocation: Store vs FBA vs buffer stock

---

### Stage 13: Amazon setup (compliance + lot/expiry reality) 📦

**Expiration date rule (practical Amazon reality):**
Amazon states ingestible products must be labeled with **expiration date or manufacturing date**; **lot numbers alone aren’t sufficient**. ([Amazon Seller Central][9])
Operational controls you must implement:

* Use **Best By** date printed on each unit (and ideally on each case).
* Maintain lot-to-shipment traceability for recalls and customer complaints.

---

### Stage 14: Local store setup (Scenario A only) 🏪

Indiana retail food operations guidance is published by Indiana’s food protection program (retail vs wholesale distinctions, checklists, plan submission). ([Government of India][10])
Sales tax registration: register and obtain RRMC through **INBiz**. ([Government of India][11])
Indiana also notes RRMC is not the same as a vendor’s license (county clerk may be involved). ([Government of India][12])

---

### Stage 15: Ongoing operations (renewals + audits + CAPA)

* Quarterly supplier scorecard (on-time, COA pass rate, complaints)
* Annual mock recall
* Annual label review (any regulation/claim changes)
* FSVP re-evaluation at least every 3 years (or sooner if issues) ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][2])

---

# 3) SKU-Specific Quality & Technical Specs (EXPANDED, measurable)

## Global baseline (applies to all 5 SKUs)

### Particle size verification

* Use **vibro sifter** + certified test sieves.
* Sampling: 100 g sample; run 5 minutes; record % retained.
* Acceptance: **≥95% passes** your target mesh, unless you intentionally sell coarse grade.

### Moisture & water activity targets (low-clump, shelf-stable)

* Moisture target: **≤6.0%** (default), allowable up to **≤7.0%** if validated stable.
* aw target: **≤0.50** (default).
  Rationale: lower aw reduces microbial growth potential and helps clumping control; low-moisture foods still require pathogen prevention controls (sanitation zoning). ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][1])

### Micro limits (starter specs you can adopt)

* TAMC: ≤100,000 cfu/g
* Yeast & Mold: ≤1,000 cfu/g
* Coliforms: ≤100 cfu/g
* E. coli: Negative / 10 g
* Salmonella: **Absent / 25 g**
  (Adjust based on your market positioning and lab method detection limits.)

### Heavy metals (starter internal targets)

* Lead (Pb) ≤0.5 ppm
* Cadmium (Cd) ≤0.3 ppm
* Arsenic (As) ≤1.0 ppm
* Mercury (Hg) ≤0.1 ppm
  *If selling nationally, consider additional risk screening due to state-level warning regimes (you’ll want counsel guidance).*

### Foreign matter controls (powder-appropriate)

* Magnets at mill feed + post-mill
* Sieve before pack
* Metal detector with recorded sensitivity checks each start/shift/changeover:

  * Typical starting sensitivity goal (verify with vendor): Fe 1.5 mm / Non-Fe 2.0 mm / SS 2.5 mm

---

## SKU specs (by product)

### 3.1 Beetroot powder

* Mesh: **80–120** (drink mix friendly)
* Moisture/aw: ≤6.0% / ≤0.50
* Color: set baseline L*a*b* from a “golden lot”; accept within **ΔE ≤ 3.0**
* Extra chem: optional nitrates baseline (if no claim, treat as internal trending)

### 3.2 Orange powder (two options)

**Option A: Whole fruit powder**

* Mesh: 80–120
* Moisture/aw: ≤6.0% / ≤0.50
* Risk: higher sugars → clumping risk → consider nitrogen flush + strong barrier film

**Option B: Peel powder**

* Mesh: **60–100** (oils can smear at very fine mesh)
* Moisture/aw: ≤6.0% / ≤0.50
* Extra testing: pesticide screen is more critical (peels concentrate residues)

### 3.3 Lemon powder (two options)

**Option A: Whole/juice solids type**

* Mesh: 80–120
* Moisture/aw: ≤6.0% / ≤0.50
* Sensory: acidic/bright; define pH (if reconstituted) as optional identity marker

**Option B: Peel powder**

* Mesh: 60–100
* Moisture/aw: ≤6.0% / ≤0.50
* Note: peel oils can impact seal integrity if dusting occurs → strict housekeeping

### 3.4 Ginger powder

* Mesh: 80–120 (premium) or 60–80 (standard spice-like)
* Moisture/aw: ≤6.0% / ≤0.50
* Sensory: pungency/heat; define odor/taste panel scoring (internal QC)

### 3.5 Carrot powder

* Mesh: 80–120
* Moisture/aw: ≤6.0% / ≤0.50
* Color: strong orange baseline; ΔE trending important (drying drift control)

# 4) Lab Documentation & Traceability System (MORE CONCRETE templates)

## 4.1 Batch Manufacturing Record (BMR) — must capture

1. Raw material receipt: supplier, farm/lot, date, weight, visual checks
2. Wash parameters: sanitizer used, concentration, contact time, rinse verification
3. Slicing: thickness range + equipment settings
4. Drying: dryer ID, time/temp profile, final moisture/aw readings
5. Milling/sieving: mill settings, sieve mesh, % pass results
6. Metal detector: sensitivity checks + rejects handling
7. Packaging: filler settings, net weight checks, seal checks, nitrogen/desiccant if used
8. Coding: lot + best-by verification sample photo
9. Yield + reconciliation: input kg vs finished packs count (shrink + loss explained)

## 4.2 Incoming COA verification

* Rule: “COA received” ≠ “COA accepted”
* Checklist: matches supplier name/address, methods, dates, lot ID, signature, specs

## 4.3 In-process QC checks

* Moisture/aw at end of drying + pre-pack
* Sieve check once per 2 hours during milling
* Net weight check: every 30 minutes (or every 50 units)
* Seal integrity: burst test or dye test every start/shift/changeover

## 4.4 Finished goods release procedure

* QA signs release only when:

  * lab COA meets spec
  * packaging checks completed
  * traceability (carton ↔ lot) confirmed

## 4.5 Sample retention plan

* Retain duration: **shelf-life + 6 months** (best practice)
* Storage: cool/dry, sealed, labeled, access-controlled

## 4.6 Complaint + recall SOP

* Complaint intake form: ASIN/UPC, lot, photos, description, health event question
* 24-hour internal triage
* Mock recall quarterly until stable; then annually

## 4.7 Organic segregation docs (if organic)

* Line clearance checklist (before organic run)
* Dedicated storage map
* Cleaning verification signoff
* Organic lot traceability map: raw → WIP → finished → shipment

---

# 6) Licensing / Registrations / Certifications (US items you must not miss)

## 6.1 FSVP program (you)

Core FDA expectations: written program verifying hazards, supplier performance, verification, and corrective actions. ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][2])

## 6.2 Prior Notice (every import)

File via ACE/ABI or PNSI; FDA describes both filing paths. ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][4])

## 6.3 Organic (if you sell as organic)

* India-to-US organic must be certified by a **USDA-accredited certifier**. ([AMS][13])
* Each imported organic shipment must be associated with an **electronic NOP Import Certificate** issued in USDA’s Organic Integrity Database (post-March 19, 2024). ([AMS][14])

# 7) Import/Export Documentation (FULL FLOW — key documents + who provides)

## 7.1 Document set (minimum)

# 8) Private Label Packaging & US Label Compliance (add the missing “Nutrition Facts logic”)

## 8.1 Nutrition Facts: required by default

Nutrition labeling is required unless a specific exemption applies. ([eCFR][15])

## 8.2 Small business exemption (decision logic)

FDA explains that small business nutrition labeling exemption exists under 21 CFR 101.9(j), generally requires annual notice filing, and products bearing nutrition claims may not qualify. ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][16])
**Practical guidance:** assume you will include Nutrition Facts unless counsel confirms exemption + you file the notice correctly.

## 8.3 Country of origin marking

CBP requires foreign-origin goods be marked with the country of origin unless an exception applies. ([Customs and Border Protection][8])

## 8.4 Amazon expiry/lot operational rule

Amazon indicates ingestible products need expiration or manufacturing date labeling; lot numbers alone are not enough. ([Amazon Seller Central][9])

---

# 11) Final Documentation Matrix (ADD-ON ROWS you must include)

You already have a matrix; these are **must-add** high-risk missing items (use same columns you required):

* **FSVP written hazard analyses** (per SKU)
* **Supplier approval & verification records** (audit/test/records review) ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][2])
* **FSVP UFI/DUNS tracking** (entry line data expectations) ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][2])
* **Prior Notice confirmations** per shipment ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][4])
* **ISF confirmations** per ocean shipment ([CBP Help][7])
* **FDA foreign facility registration confirmation + biennial renewal logs** ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][5])
* **U.S. Agent designation evidence** ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][6])
* **Organic NOP Import Certificates** (if organic) ([AMS][14])
* **Indiana retail food start checklist + plan/inspection artifacts** (Scenario A) ([Government of India][10])
* **Indiana RRMC registration proof + renewal status** ([Government of India][11])
