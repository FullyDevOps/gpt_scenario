## Assumptions (explicit) ✅

1. **Products are “food ingredients” (not dietary supplements)** unless you intentionally market them with “supplement-style” claims/directions. This keeps you under **FDA food labeling (Nutrition Facts)** rather than **Supplement Facts**. (Decision logic included later.)
2. **Five SKUs** now; system designed to scale to **10 SKUs** by adding parallel raw-material bays + allergen/organic segregation + standardized specs and labels.
3. **No additives** by default (100% single-ingredient powders). If you choose **lemon/orange “juice solids” powders**, those typically require carriers (e.g., maltodextrin) → label changes + spec changes.
4. **Indiana destination**; you will use a **customs broker + freight forwarder** and act as (or appoint) the **FSVP importer**.

## Scenario A vs B (quick)

| Topic                   | A) Local store + Amazon                                                       | B) Amazon only                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sales tax               | Must register to collect IN sales tax + obtain RRMC                           | Often still needed if you also sell direct; Amazon marketplace tax rules vary, but plan for IN registration if you store/sell in IN |
| Local retail compliance | More exposure to local inspections, storage expectations, retail presentation | Mostly Amazon gating + FBA compliance; fewer local-facing steps                                                                     |
| Inventory               | Split between store stock + FBA                                               | Primarily FBA (or prep center → FBA)                                                                                                |
| Operational complexity  | Higher                                                                        | Lower                                                                                                                               |

Indiana sales tax registration for a **Registered Retail Merchant Certificate (RRMC)** is done via **INBiz** ([Government of India][3]).

---

## Compliance milestones (non-negotiable)

1. **Foreign facility registration + UFI (DUNS) + U.S. Agent** for India plant ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][4])
2. **FSVP importer program** in place (hazard analysis, supplier verification, records) ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][1])
3. **Prior Notice** filed for every shipment ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][2])
4. **US label compliance** (identity, net quantity, ingredients, allergens, responsible firm, origin marking, lot/best-by) ([eCFR][5])
5. **Amazon ingestible expiration/best-by labeling** on units + cartons ([Amazon Seller Central][6])
6. **Organic**: if you sell as “USDA Organic,” India operations must be certified by a **USDA-accredited certifier** (USDA ended prior India recognition arrangement) ([AMS][7])

---

## Simple timeline (month-by-month to first shipment + first Amazon launch) 🗓️

**Month 1**

* India: business formation + FSSAI licensing track + facility lease shortlist + equipment quotations
* US: LLC/EIN, bank, basic brand system (SKU spec sheets, label draft system), select broker/forwarder

**Month 2**

* India: finalize site + utilities + order dryer/mill/packing line; build GMP zones; approve labels/artwork
* US: FDA Industry Systems accounts; assign U.S. Agent; create FSVP framework; barcode strategy; Amazon account setup

**Month 3**

* India: install/commission; pilot runs; validate moisture/aw/mesh; establish COA templates; stability start
* US: finalize listings, compliance checks, packaging proof approvals, prep plan (FNSKU, carton labels)

**Month 4**

* First production lot + full test panel + shipment booking + Prior Notice + customs clearance
* Ship to Indiana (or directly to prep center) → send to FBA → **listings go live**

**Month 5**

# 2) Step-by-Step Execution Plan (Very Detailed) 🧩

## Stage 1: India business setup + registrations (manufacturer/exporter)

1. **Entity + tax**

   1. Register entity (proprietorship/partnership/Pvt Ltd) + PAN/TAN as needed
   2. Obtain **GST** (needed for formal B2B + exports workflow)
2. **Food business licensing**

   1. Apply for appropriate **FSSAI license** via FoSCoS (manufacturing/processing + packing)
   2. Maintain license documentation and approved product categories
      (FSSAI licensing regulations compendium + FoSCoS document requirements are the authoritative references) ([fssai.gov.in][8])
3. **Exporter identity**

   1. Obtain **IEC (Importer-Exporter Code)** from DGFT (mandatory for export) ([DGFT][9])
   2. Register with **APEDA (RCMC)** if product category falls under APEDA scheduled products / processed foods export channel ([apeda.gov.in][10])
4. **Contracts**

   1. Manufacturing + QA agreement between you and friend (specs, testing, release, recalls, IP/artwork control)
   2. Define: batch size, COA requirements, rework rules, deviation/CAPA timelines, liability split

**Checklist (Stage 1)**

* [ ] Entity formed + GST
* [ ] FSSAI license path initiated (layout, water test, product list, etc.) ([foscos.fssai.gov.in][11])
* [ ] IEC obtained ([DGFT][9])
* [ ] APEDA RCMC (if applicable) ([apeda.gov.in][10])
* [ ] QA + private label agreements signed

---

## Stage 2: Facility location, zoning, hygiene requirements, utilities

**Target size (for 3,000 packs/month now + scale to 10 SKUs):**

* **1,500–2,500 sq ft** (small-scale) minimum workable
* Separate zones (see Stage 5/6): Raw receiving, wash/trim, slicing, drying, milling/sieving, packing, FG storage, QC corner, packaging material store

**Utilities (minimum)**

* Potable water source + filtration; documented potability testing (micro/chemical)
* 3-phase electricity (dryer + mill + packing line)
* Dehumidification/AC for milling/packing (powders clump; humidity drives aw)
* Drainage designed to prevent pooling (wash area separate from dry zone)

**Hygiene zoning (must)**

* **Wet zone**: receiving → washing → slicing/blanching
* **Dry high-care zone**: drying discharge → milling → sieving → packing
* Strict barrier between wet and dry (doors/air curtains, footwear change, handwash)

---

## Stage 3: Equipment procurement + line design (sized for 5 SKUs, 3,000 packs/month; pouches + jars; 8oz + 16oz)

### Throughput sizing (locked output → convert to kg)

Per SKU/month powder:

* 300 × 8 oz (227 g) = **68.1 kg**
* 300 × 16 oz (454 g) = **136.2 kg**
* Total per SKU/month = **204.3 kg**
  All SKUs total/month = **~1,021.5 kg powder/month**

**Design daily capacity (assume 20 production days/month):**

* Powder output needed: ~51 kg/day
* Raw input depends on moisture/yield (vegetables often ~8–15% powder yield). Plan raw handling for **400–800 kg/day wet produce**.

### Required equipment families

1. Wash + prep
2. Slice/dice + optional blanch
3. Dryer (tray or belt; freeze-dry optional premium)
4. Mill/grinder + dust control
5. Vibro sifter (mesh verification)
6. Magnets + metal detector
7. Filling: auger/weigh filler for powders
8. Pouch sealing line + jar filling/capping
9. Coding (lot/date) + carton sealing
10. Basic QC instruments

(Full table in Section 5.)

---

## Stage 4: Raw material sourcing system (conventional vs organic)

### Conventional sourcing (baseline)

1. Approved farms/mandis with pesticide-use transparency (even if informal)
2. Incoming checks: visual quality, spoilage %, foreign matter, washability
3. **Testing plan**: pesticide residues (risk-based), heavy metals (risk-based), micro on finished goods

### Organic sourcing (system change)

To sell as **USDA Organic**, you need organic certification by a **USDA-accredited certifier** for the operation(s) involved (farm/processor/handler), and India’s earlier recognition arrangement was ended by USDA AMS. ([AMS][7])
Operational changes:

1. Dedicated/segregated raw storage (organic vs conventional)
2. Documented supplier organic certificates + transaction documents
3. Line clearance + cleaning verification between conventional ↔ organic
4. Organic-only packaging material segregation (avoid mix-ups)
5. Organic claim approvals on labels controlled by certification body

---

## Stage 5: Manufacturing SOP (Beetroot example, then adapt for other SKUs)

### 5A) Beetroot powder – master SOP (example)

**Receiving → Washing → Sorting → Slicing → (Optional blanch) → Drying → Milling → Sieving → Metal detection → Packaging → Coding → Case pack → Palletize**

1. **Receiving**

   * Record: supplier, farm/lot, date/time, vehicle condition, weight, temperature (ambient acceptable), spoilage %
   * Reject if: mold, excessive rot, chemical odor, pest contamination

2. **Washing**

   * 2-step: gross soil removal → sanitized rinse (validated sanitizer concentration & contact time)
   * Record sanitizer ppm + changeover frequency

3. **Sorting/Trimming**

   * Remove rotten sections, stones, stems, foreign matter

4. **Slicing**

   * Target 3–6 mm slices for consistent drying
   * Record slicer settings + slice thickness check (sample 10 slices/lot)

5. **Optional blanching (decision logic)**

   * **Use blanching if**: enzymatic browning risk, high initial micro load, color stability needed
   * **Avoid blanching if**: you need maximum nutrient retention + minimal process water
   * For beetroot: often **no blanch** is acceptable if drying is fast and hygiene is strong; choose blanch if quality issues appear

6. **Drying (decision logic)**

   * Goal: hit moisture + aw targets (see SKU specs)
   * Tray dryer typical: 55–65°C; control time/airflow
   * Record: dryer temp profile, load weight, time, final moisture/aw checks

7. **Milling**

   * Pre-break: hammer mill/pin mill; manage heat rise (powder color/odor changes)
   * Control dust explosion risk (dust collection + housekeeping)

8. **Sieving**

   * Use vibro sifter to hit mesh spec (e.g., 80–120 mesh)
   * Record sieve ID, mesh size, pass/fail, re-mill policy

9. **Foreign matter controls**

   * Inline **magnets** before metal detector
   * **Metal detector** after sifter, before packing; record sensitivity checks (test wands)

10. **Packaging**

* Pouch: weigh fill → nitrogen flush (optional) → heat seal → zipper check
* Jar: fill → induction seal/liner → cap torque check
* Net weight checks each defined interval (e.g., every 30 minutes)

11. **Coding**

* Lot code format (example): BR-YYMMDD-Shift-Batch#
* Print **Best By** or **Expiration** date (Amazon ingestibles require it; lot alone isn’t enough) ([Amazon Seller Central][6])

12. **Case pack + palletize**

* Case label includes SKU, count, lot, best-by
* Pallet labels if shipping palletized

---

### 5B) Adaptations by SKU (process deltas)

**Orange powder – two options**

* **Option 1: Whole fruit powder (rare, but possible)**

  * Challenges: sugars → stickiness; color browning
  * Use lower drying temp, tighter humidity control; milling may gum up
* **Option 2: Peel powder (common, stable)**

  * Source peels from hygienic peeling; manage pesticide/wax risks (prefer organic)
  * Consider brief blanch/steam or validated wash to reduce surface microbes

**Lemon powder – two options**

* **Option 1: Whole fruit powder**

  * High acidity; can still brown; peel oils dominate flavor
* **Option 2A: Peel powder (common)**

  * Essential oils: can clump; may need coarser mesh range
* **Option 2B: “Juice solids powder”**

  * Typically **spray-dried** with carrier (maltodextrin/gum) → not single-ingredient; label + nutrition changes

**Ginger powder**

* Often needs strong foreign-matter control (soil, stones)
* Drying: moderate temps; milling: manage heat to preserve aroma
* Micro risk: soil-associated pathogens → emphasize sanitation + validated drying

**Carrot powder**

* Higher enzymatic activity → blanching often helpful for color stability
* Drying needs careful control to avoid “cooked” notes

---

## Stage 6: Quality system (GMP, sanitation SSOPs, pest, traceability, recalls, coding)

You want your India plant to operate at a “US-import-ready” level:

1. **GMP / Preventive controls mindset**

   * Even low-moisture foods have sanitation requirements; FDA has specific low-moisture sanitation guidance directionally aligned with 21 CFR 117 ([eCFR][12])
2. **SSOPs**

   * Master cleaning schedule, chemical control log, ATP (optional), dry-clean protocol in dry zones
3. **Pest control**

   * Contracted pest control; bait map; trend logs; corrective actions
4. **Traceability**

   * One-step back/one-step forward; batch coding on unit and cases
5. **Recall readiness**

   * Mock recall quarterly; target: identify all customers + inventory locations within 2–4 hours

---

## Stage 7: Lab testing plan + COA workflow (release criteria)

**Release model**

* Each production lot gets a COA with: moisture, aw, mesh, micro (at least core panel), heavy metals (risk-based frequency), pesticides (risk-based frequency)

**Frequency (starter)**

* **Every lot**: moisture, aw, mesh, sensory, net weight, metal detector verification record
* **Every lot (or at least monthly per SKU)**: micro panel (TAMC, YM, coliform/E. coli, Salmonella absence in 25g)
* **Quarterly per SKU** (or per higher-risk lots): heavy metals
* **Quarterly to semiannual** (conventional): pesticide multi-residue; citrus peel more frequent

**COA workflow**

1. Manufacture lot → hold as “QUARANTINE”
2. Pull composite sample per sampling plan (Section 4)
3. Send to lab (ISO 17025 preferred)
4. Review vs spec → approve/reject
5. Release for export only after COA approval + packaging verification pass

---

## Stage 8: Private label packaging workflow (artwork, approvals, barcodes, carton/pallet labels)

1. **Artwork master control**

   * Version control: SKU + size + format (pouch/jar) + revision
2. **Regulatory label review**

   * Verify identity statement, net quantity (oz + grams), ingredient statement, allergens, responsible firm, origin, lot/best-by ([eCFR][5])
3. **Barcode strategy**

   * Retail: UPC (GS1 recommended)
   * Amazon: FNSKU on units; carton labels; case-pack rules (Section 8)
4. **Packaging proof approval**

   * You sign final proofs; manufacturer prints only signed versions

---

## Stage 9: Export readiness (India export steps + logistics + documentation)

1. Confirm IEC + exporter setup ([DGFT][9])
2. Confirm APEDA RCMC if applicable ([apeda.gov.in][10])
3. Appoint freight forwarder (or yours) and define Incoterm
4. Prepare commercial docs: invoice, packing list, COA, COO, insurance (if CIF)
5. Palletization plan; container stuffing plan; seal numbers recorded
6. Handover to carrier at port per Incoterm

---

## Stage 10: US import readiness (Importer responsibilities, broker/forwarder selection, compliance)

1. Create FDA Industry Systems account + ensure facility registration requirements are met ([access.fda.gov][13])
2. Ensure foreign facility has **UFI (DUNS)** recognized by FDA for registration ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][4])
3. Appoint/confirm **FSVP importer** (you or service provider) ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][1])
4. Select **customs broker** (FDA/food capable) + forwarder
5. Set product classification/HS code logic with broker (don’t guess)

---

## Stage 11: Shipping & customs clearance (document set + timeline + failure points)

**Every shipment must have Prior Notice** submitted via PNSI or integrated broker filing; confirmation number retained ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][2]).

Common failure points:

* Missing/incorrect FDA facility registration/UFI
* Prior Notice errors (product code, manufacturer, lot, quantity)
* Labeling issues (allergens, net quantity, responsible firm)
* Missing COA or mismatch with lot codes
* Organic claim without USDA-accredited certification ([AMS][7])

---

## Stage 12: Distribution choices (Indiana receiving → store / 3PL / Amazon FBA)

1. **Indiana receiving**

   * Inspect cartons, verify lot/best-by, verify seals, record receiving log
2. **Option (a) Local store inventory**

   * Maintain clean, dry, pest-controlled storage; FIFO/FEFO
3. **Option (b) 3PL**

   * Choose 3PL with lot/best-by tracking
4. **Option (c) Amazon FBA**

   * Apply FNSKU, carton labels; meet ingestible date labeling rules ([Amazon Seller Central][6])

---

## Stage 13: Amazon selling setup (listing, compliance, claims risk management, FBA rules)

1. Category selection (Grocery vs Specialty) + potential gating (varies)
2. Listing content must match label and COA (avoid disease claims)
3. **Expiration/Best-by required** on ingestibles; lot number alone is insufficient ([Amazon Seller Central][6])
4. Prep plan:

   * Unit label (FNSKU + best-by)
   * Carton label (SKU/count/lot/best-by)
   * Case pack consistency

---

## Stage 14: Local store selling setup (Scenario A only)

1. **Sales tax / RRMC** via INBiz ([Government of India][3])
2. Determine if you need a local retail food permit:

   * Indiana definition indicates certain businesses offering only **prepackaged non-TCS foods** may be excluded from “retail food establishment” requirements, but local interpretation varies ([Legal Information Institute][14])
3. Follow Indiana retail food business guidance as applicable (storage, pest control, sourcing) ([Government of India][15])
4. Product liability insurance + recall plan posted

---

## Stage 15: Ongoing operations (renewals, audits, scorecards, CAPA, continuous improvement)

* Quarterly supplier scorecards (OTIF, COA pass rate, complaints/ppm, audit findings)
* Annual mock recall + label review
* Trend moisture/aw/micro; tighten specs as you scale
* Prepare for customer audits (Amazon issues, retail buyers)

---

# Shipping / Incoterms Recommendations (required) 🚢✈️

## 1) Estimate shipment characteristics for 3,000 packs/month (assumptions labeled)

### Output (locked)

* Total packs/month = **3,000**
* Pack sizes: **8 oz (227g)** and **16 oz (454g)**
* Formats: **pouches + jars**

### Packaging/Logistics assumptions (editable later)

* Split (assumption): **50% pouches / 50% jars** across production
* Case packs (assumption):

  * 8 oz pouches: **24 units/case**
  * 16 oz pouches: **12 units/case**
  * 8 oz jars: **12 units/case**
  * 16 oz jars: **6 units/case**
* Approx gross weights (assumption):

  * 8 oz pouch unit: **0.25 kg**
  * 16 oz pouch unit: **0.48 kg**
  * 8 oz jar unit: **0.35 kg**
  * 16 oz jar unit: **0.62 kg**
* Case cube (assumption):

  * 8 oz pouch case: ~**0.035 m³**
  * 16 oz pouch case: ~**0.028 m³**
  * 8 oz jar case: ~**0.031 m³**
  * 16 oz jar case: ~**0.043 m³**

### Approx monthly shipment (based on those assumptions)

* Total gross weight: **~1.5 metric tons**
* Total volume: **~10 m³**
* Pallets: **~2–4 standard pallets** (depends on stacking + jar protection)

This is a classic **Sea LCL** profile (charged by W/M: weight/measure).

---

## 2) Best shipping method (beginner vs cost optimization)

### Beginner (risk-managed)

* **Sea LCL monthly** + forwarder + customs broker
* Add marine cargo insurance (even if not required)

### Cost optimization (after 2–3 stable cycles)

* Consolidate to **bi-monthly larger LCL** or **FCL** when volume is high enough (typically when you’re consistently palletizing 8–10+ pallets/month)

### Air freight (use only for)

* First pilot validation (small quantity)
* Urgent stockout
* High-margin premium jars (still usually expensive)

---

## 3) Safest Incoterm for beginner importer + EXW vs FOB vs CIF vs DDP

### Recommended for you (beginner-safe + control): **FOB (India port)**

* Supplier handles India-side export and loading on vessel
* You control carrier, insurance, and US clearance through your broker/forwarder

### Pros/cons table

| Incoterm  | Pros                                                                       | Cons                                                                                     | Best use                                                               |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **EXW**   | Cheapest “on paper”                                                        | You handle export pickup, export compliance, port steps in India; high error risk        | Not recommended for first 3–6 shipments                                |
| **FOB** ✅ | Balanced control; supplier handles export side; you control freight/broker | You still manage ocean booking + insurance + US clearance                                | Best default                                                           |
| **CIF**   | Supplier arranges ocean + insurance to US port                             | Less control over carrier/fees; still your US clearance responsibility                   | Acceptable if supplier has strong logistics                            |
| **DDP**   | Simplest operationally                                                     | Often opaque; may misalign importer-of-record/FSVP responsibilities; higher hidden costs | Only with very experienced provider + clearly defined compliance roles |

---

## 4) Step-by-step import flow (recommended option + fallback)

### Recommended: **FOB India + Sea LCL → Indiana**

1. You issue PO + specs + label proofs + COA requirements
2. India produces lot → quarantines → lab tests → COA pass → packs
3. Forwarder books LCL; cartons palletized; container loaded
4. Export docs finalized (invoice, packing list, COO, BL, COA)
5. Broker files entry + FDA data
6. **Prior Notice submitted** (via broker/ACE or PNSI) and confirmation retained ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][2])
7. Arrival US port → CBP/FDA may “May Proceed” or exam/hold
8. Cleared → drayage to warehouse/Indiana
9. Receive → inspect → lot/best-by verification → allocate to FBA/store

### Fallback: **FOB + Air (pilot)**

Same flow, but:

* Airway bill replaces BL
* Transit time days not weeks
* Higher cost; use smaller quantity to validate demand + QC

---

# 3) SKU-Specific Quality & Technical Specs (per SKU) 🧪

> These are **practical buyer specs** for import-ready powders. You can tighten later. Always confirm with your lab and any retail/Amazon category requirements.

## Common definitions (apply to all)

* **Mesh verification**: sieve stack test (e.g., ASTM E11 sieves) on a representative sample
* **Moisture**: oven/Karl Fischer as appropriate
* **Water activity (aw)**: calibrated aw meter
* **Micro**: ISO methods or FDA BAM equivalents
* **Heavy metals**: ICP-MS
* **Pesticides**: multi-residue LC-MS/MS + GC-MS/MS (especially citrus peel)

---

## Beetroot powder

* **Mesh range**: 80–120 mesh (typical); accept: ≥90% passing target mesh
* **Moisture**: ≤6.0% (targets flowability)
* **aw**: ≤0.30 (reduces microbial growth + caking)
* **Sensory**: deep red; earthy; no burnt notes; no musty odor
* **Micro limits (starter)**:

  * TAMC ≤100,000 cfu/g
  * Yeast & Mold ≤10,000 cfu/g
  * Coliforms ≤100 cfu/g
  * **E. coli**: negative/1g
  * **Salmonella**: absent/25g
* **Chem risks**: heavy metals (Pb/Cd/As/Hg); **nitrates** (track/trend); pesticides (conventional)
* **Allergen statement**: “Processed in a facility that may handle …” (only if true; otherwise keep facility allergen-free)
* **Foreign matter**: magnets + sifter + metal detector; record sensitivity checks
* **Shelf-life**: 18–24 months (validate via stability)
* **COA fields (minimum)**: identity, lot, mfg date, best-by, mesh %, moisture, aw, micro results, heavy metals (when tested), pesticide summary (when tested), lab accreditation details, methods, analyst/date

---

## Orange powder (two options)

### Option A: Whole orange powder

* **Mesh**: 60–100 (avoid over-fines that cake)
* **Moisture/aw**: moisture ≤5.0%, aw ≤0.30 (sugar drives stickiness)
* **Sensory**: orange aroma; no caramel/burnt notes; no rancid oil notes
* **Micro**: same core limits; pay attention to yeast/mold (sugars)
* **Chem**: pesticides more critical; consider higher testing frequency

### Option B: Orange peel powder

* **Mesh**: 40–80 or 60–80 (peel oils + fiber)
* **Moisture/aw**: moisture ≤6.0%; aw ≤0.35
* **Micro**: core limits; peel surface risk → sanitation emphasis
* **Chem**: **pesticides/wax** risk (peel concentrates residues) → strong preference for organic or robust testing

---

## Lemon powder (three practical realities)

### Option A: Whole lemon powder

* Similar to whole orange but more acidic; peel oils dominate flavor

### Option B: Lemon peel powder (most common “single-ingredient”)

* **Mesh**: 40–80 or 60–80
* **Moisture/aw**: moisture ≤6.0%, aw ≤0.35
* **Chem**: peel residue risk high → pesticide panel frequent (conventional)

### Option C: Lemon “juice solids powder”

* Usually requires **carrier** (not single-ingredient) → label must declare carrier; specs include carrier %, DE, etc.

---

## Ginger powder

* **Mesh**: 80–120 (popular for beverages)
* **Moisture/aw**: moisture ≤6.0%; aw ≤0.35
* **Sensory**: pungent, aromatic; no mold/musty; no burnt
* **Micro**: core limits; tighten Salmonella controls (soil-associated risk)
* **Chem**: heavy metals + pesticides (risk-based)
* **Foreign matter**: stones/soil risk → stronger screening + washing

---

## Carrot powder

* **Mesh**: 80–100
* **Moisture/aw**: moisture ≤6.0%; aw ≤0.30–0.35
* **Sensory**: bright orange; sweet carrot; no cooked/burnt
* **Micro**: core limits; watch yeast/mold if drying slow
* **Process note**: blanching often improves color stability

# 4) Lab Documentation & Traceability System 📚

## Batch manufacturing record template (must capture)

1. Product + SKU code + pack size + format
2. Raw materials: supplier, incoming lot IDs, receiving results
3. Processing logs: wash sanitizer ppm, slicing thickness checks, dryer temps/time, mill settings
4. In-process QC: moisture/aw checkpoints, sieve checks, metal detector checks
5. Packaging: packaging material lot IDs, label revision, net weight checks
6. Final: finished lot ID, quantities produced, holds, deviations, rework
7. Release: COA results + QA approval signature

## Incoming COA verification + supplier qualification

* Supplier onboarding: questionnaire + facility photos + process outline
* Verify COA vs your spec; trend issues
* Annual supplier review + corrective action tracking

## In-process QC checks (minimum starter)

* Moisture/aw: at dryer discharge + post-mill
* Mesh test: first-off + every X kg milled
* Metal detector: start/end shift and hourly test pieces
* Net weight: every 30 minutes
* Seal integrity: pouch seal peel test; jar torque check

## Finished goods release procedure

* QA holds product until COA pass + packaging verification pass
* Only released lots can be exported

## Sample retention plan

* Retain **2 × 200g** samples per finished lot (one in India, one in US)
* Retain for **12 months past best-by** (or minimum 24 months if best-by is long)

## Complaint and recall SOP + mock recall

* Complaint triage: safety vs quality vs shipping damage
* Mock recall quarterly; demonstrate trace to all customers and inventory points within 2–4 hours

## Organic segregation docs (if organic)

* Organic receiving logs (certificates, transaction docs)
* Dedicated storage map
* Line clearance checklist + cleaning verification
* Label release approvals controlled by certifier requirements ([AMS][7])

---

# 6) Licensing / Registrations / Certifications (India + US) 🧾

## US (core)

1. **Foreign facility registration** (India manufacturer) required for food facilities making/packing/holding food for US consumption ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][16])

   * Must renew biennially (Oct 1–Dec 31 of even years) ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][4])
   * Requires UFI (DUNS accepted) ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][4])
2. **FSVP importer** must verify foreign supplier controls for imported food ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][1])
3. **Prior Notice** required for each shipment ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][2])
4. **Food labeling compliance** (net quantity, ingredients, allergens, nutrition unless exempt, etc.) ([eCFR][5])
5. **Country-of-origin marking** on imported goods/containers (unless specific exceptions) ([Customs and Border Protection][17])

## Organic (USDA Organic)

* USDA ended the India recognition agreement; plan for **USDA-accredited certification** route for India operations involved in “organic” supply chain ([AMS][7])

## India (core)

* **FSSAI licensing/regulatory compliance** for food manufacturing/packing ([fssai.gov.in][8])
* **DGFT IEC** for export ([DGFT][9])
* **APEDA RCMC** where applicable for export ecosystem ([apeda.gov.in][10])

1. Factory packs → pallets/cartons staged
2. Truck to India port warehouse/CFS (LCL) or container yard (FCL)
3. Vessel → US port
4. Customs/FDA clearance
5. Drayage to Indiana receiving or 3PL/prep center
6. Prep to FBA or allocate to store inventory

---

# 8) Private Label Packaging & US Label Compliance (8oz & 16oz; pouches + jars) 🏷️

## Packaging specs (recommended)

### Pouches

* Material: multi-layer barrier (e.g., PET/AL/PE or metallized PET)
* Thickness: ~100–130 microns (assumption)
* Features: zipper + strong heat seal, tear notch
* Optional: nitrogen flush (improves oxidation control)
* Optional: desiccant (use decision logic below)

### Jars

* PET or glass (PET recommended initially to reduce breakage)
* Liner: induction seal strongly recommended
* Cap torque controlled; tamper-evident band optional

## Desiccant decision logic

Use desiccant if:

* aw drifts upward in humid climates
* product caking complaints occur
* you ship during high humidity seasons or store conditions vary

Avoid if:

* you cannot control food-grade desiccant handling and labeling warnings

## Packaging decision matrix (starter)

| SKU            | Best format          | Why                            | Shelf-life impact     | Breakage risk | FBA handling | Cost impact |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Beetroot       | Both (pouch primary) | High volume, stable            | Good if aw controlled | Low (pouch)   | Easy         | Low         |
| Orange (whole) | Pouch                | Sticky risk—minimize headspace | Needs strong barrier  | Low           | Easy         | Low         |
| Orange peel    | Jar or pouch         | Aroma retention; premium feel  | Jar can retain aroma  | Medium        | Moderate     | Medium      |
| Lemon peel     | Jar or pouch         | Premium citrus peel            | Needs residue control | Medium        | Moderate     | Medium      |
| Ginger         | Both                 | Popular; premium jar works     | Stable if dry         | Medium        | Moderate     | Medium      |
| Carrot         | Pouch                | Stable; cost efficient         | Stable                | Low           | Easy         | Low         |

---

## US label elements (what must be on your labels)

1. **Statement of identity** (“Beetroot Powder”, “Ginger Powder”, etc.)
2. **Net quantity** on PDP in **oz + grams** ([eCFR][5])
3. **Ingredients** (single-ingredient: “Ingredients: Beetroot powder”)
4. **Allergen statement** if applicable; remember sesame is a major allergen as of 1/1/2023 ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][18])
5. **Nutrition Facts** unless exempt (small business exemption exists but has conditions) ([U.S. Food and Drug Administration][19])
6. **Responsible firm** (your US LLC name/address; “Imported by …”)
7. **Country of origin** marking (e.g., “Product of India”) ([Customs and Border Protection][17])
8. **Lot/batch + Best By/Expiration** (Amazon requires an expiration/best-by/manufacture date on ingestibles; lot alone not enough) ([Amazon Seller Central][6])
9. Storage instructions (“Store in a cool, dry place. Reseal tightly.”)

---

## Claims compliance + proof checklist (risk controls)

**Avoid disease claims** (e.g., “treats blood pressure/diabetes”).
Safer claims:

* “No additives,” “No preservatives” (only if true and controlled)
* “Vegan,” “Gluten-free” (requires cross-contact controls + documented rationale/testing as needed)
* “Non-GMO” (requires supplier attestations/testing strategy)
* “Organic” only with proper certification pathway ([AMS][7])

**Evidence checklist (keep in compliance folder)**

* Supplier declarations
* Cleaning/segregation SOPs (allergen/organic)
* COAs for key risks (micro, metals, pesticides)
* Label approvals and revision history

---

## Barcode plan (UPC + Amazon)

* **Retail UPC**: GS1 (recommended for store + broad retail)
* **Amazon**: GTIN exemption may be possible sometimes, but don’t rely on it for a scalable system
* **Amazon FNSKU**: print/apply to each unit (or have manufacturer print if you control accuracy)
* **Carton labels**: SKU, count, lot, best-by
* **Pallet labels**: optional but helpful for LTL/3PL receiving

## Advanced optimization path (after stable 3,000 packs/month) 🚀

1. Upgrade from tray dryer → belt dryer for throughput consistency
2. Add inline checkweigher + automated rejection
3. Implement stronger environmental monitoring in dry zones (trend-based)
4. Move to larger consolidated shipments (less frequent, lower per-unit freight)
5. Expand to 10 SKUs using the same: spec templates, COA templates, label system, and segregation logic

---

If you want, I can also generate **ready-to-use templates** (in-chat) for:

* Product specification sheets (5 SKUs × 2 sizes × 2 formats)
* COA template (exact fields)
* Batch record template (printable structure)
* Supplier quality agreement outline
