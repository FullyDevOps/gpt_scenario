## Beginner-safe vs Advanced optimization paths (operational summary) 🧭

### Beginner-safe recommended path ✅

1. Pilot shipment by **air** (small batch) to validate labels + Amazon receiving behavior
2. Ongoing monthly **ocean LCL + FOB** with your chosen broker/forwarder
3. Conservative claims + strong COA discipline + strict lot/best-by controls

### Advanced optimization path 💰

1. Consolidate shipments (bi-monthly), reduce per-shipment fixed fees
2. Tighten specs + trend data to reduce test cost without losing defensibility
3. Move to partial FCL when volume consistently supports it; negotiate long-term rates

If you want the next continuation: I can convert the matrix into **two role-based binders** (“India Export Binder” + “US Import/Amazon Binder”) with the exact folder structure and naming convention for audit readiness (no files; just the structure and templates).
